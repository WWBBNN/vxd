/*! \mainpage bvis1 : Brown Visualizer Library
* This library provides a GUI frontend to the vidpro1 library using vgui.
*
* \section bvis1_overview Overview
*
* The bvis1 library provides the framework for building a GUI frontend
* to vidpro.  Brown Eyes is a specific application (found in the examples
* subdirectory) that uses this framework to include all available classes
* in vidpro1 and bvis.  The design of bvis1 allows for the creation of 
* new GUI applications using a custom set of processes, tools, and menus
* with minimal effort.
*
* The bvis1_manager uses vgui to create views of the vidpro1_repository and
* handles interactions with the data.  The manager uses a bvis1_displayer
* object to convert each bpro1_storage object in the repository into a 
* vgui_tableau for viewing.  Each storage class containing viewable data
* must have a corresponding class derived from the abstract base class
* bvis1_displayer.  The manager allows for multiple views into the
* repository by dividing the rendering area into a grid (see 
* vgui_grid_tableau).  Within each grid cell a bvis1_view_tableau 
* maintains properties of the current view.  The bvis1_view_tableau
* also forwards all events to the active tool.  The abstract bvis1_tool
* is the base class for all tools.  Tools allow customized handling of
* user events to provide interaction with vgui view structures and the
* underlying data structures.
