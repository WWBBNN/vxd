/*! \mainpage vidpro1 : Video Processing Library
* This library provides a generic framework for applying video processing algorithms.
*
* \section vidpro1_overview Overview
*
* The vidpro1_process_manager is responsible for managing the flow of data to and from
* arbitrary video processing algorithms.  The vidpro1_repository is responsible for
* storing and managing all of the data used as input to or output from a video process.
* Data within the repository is stored as collections of smart pointers to 
* bpro1d_storage objects.  The bpro1d_storage class is an abstract base class for 
* derived storage classes that may store any type of data.  The bpro1d_process class
* is an abstract base class for derived process classes that execute various algorithms
* Thus, a bpro1d_storage class is a wrapper around your data structures while a
* bpro1d_process is a wrapper around your algorithm.  Additional parameters to a
* process are managed by the bpro1d_parameters class.
