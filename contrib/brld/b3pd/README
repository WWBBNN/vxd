Brown 3rd Party Libraries

This subdirectory is the local equivalent of v3p found at the root of
VXL.  Third party libraries that are required by other LEMS VXL code
can be included here.  This does not include all required thrid party
libraries.  In general, libraries added to this directory meet
additional criteria:

1) No longer publicly maintained or difficult to find.
2) Require some level of porting to use them in VXL across all
   platforms.

Very large libraries that are maintained by other groups (such as
Coin3D) should not be include here if users can easily obtain and
install them.

Make sure you include all licence and readme file that were part of
the original distribution.  Try to follow the conventions of v3p.
