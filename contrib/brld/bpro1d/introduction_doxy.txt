/*! \mainpage bpro1d : Brown Process Library
* This library provides a set of base classes for process, storage, and parameters object.
*
* \section bpro1d_overview Overview
*
* The bpro1d_storage class is an abstract base class for 
* derived storage classes that may store any type of data.  The bpro1d_process class
* is an abstract base class for derived process classes that execute various algorithms
* Thus, a bpro1d_storage class is a wrapper around your data structures while a
* bpro1d_process is a wrapper around your algorithm.  Additional parameters to a
* process are managed by the bpro1d_parameters class.
