/*! \mainpage bdifd : Brown Multiview Differential Geometry Library
*
* \section introduction Introduction
** 
* This library implements methods for multiview differential geometry of curves
* as in the papers:
*
* @article{Fabbri:Kimia:IJCV2016,
*  title={Multiview Differential Geometry of Curves},
*  author={Fabbri, Ricardo and Kimia, Benjamin B},
*  journal={International Journal of Computer Vision},
*  pages={1--23},
*  year={2016},
*  volume = {117},
*  doi="10.1007/s11263-016-0912-7",

*  publisher={Springer}
* }
*
* And

* R. Fabbri, B. B. Kimia, "High-Order Differential geometry of Curves for
* Multiview Reconstruction and Matching", EMMCVPR 2005, Lecture Notes in
* Computer Science, 3757, pp. 645-660, 2005.
*
* The file algo/tests/test_diff_geometry.cxx contains a detailed example on how
* to use the code. Tests are provided with and without intrinsic parameters.  If
* you are dealing with intrinsic parameters, it is more convenient to look at
* the block of code that considers this situation.  However, many people prefer
* to pre-calibrate their cameras and only consider rotations and translations,
* in which case the code without intrinsic parameters can be used.
* 
* \todo Clean up and redesign the library, and rename the old one as bdifd1
*
* \todo The methods in bdifd_util are not all needed, and can be moved to an
* utilities library.
