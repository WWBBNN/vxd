/*! \mainpage dbecl : Development Brown Epipolar Curve Library
*
* This library deals with methods that treat the epipole geometrically. Although
* the name has "curve" in it, some functionality is not necessarily related to
* curves and are more generally applicable, such as dbecl_epipole and
* dbecl_epiband.
