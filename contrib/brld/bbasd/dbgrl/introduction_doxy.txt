* \section dbgrl_overview Overview
*                                                       
* This is a general purpose graph library. All the generic classes are templatized 
* so that graph functions return the type of objects your particular graph is 
* working with instead of the base object classes.
*
* The catch is dbgrl classes cannot be used directly. The correct way to use them is
* to subclass all the generic dbgrl classes ((dbgrl_vertex), (dbgrl_edge) and (dbgrl_graph)) 
* classes. This is necessary due to template instantiation complications with cross referenced
* template classes.
