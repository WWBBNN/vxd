// \brief Essentially Non-Oscillatory 1D interpolation resulting in third order polynomial
// \author Based on original code by  H. Can Aras, @brown.edu
// \date 2006-11-23
//
// The algorithm uses ENO idea to fit third order polynomials between each point sample pair.
// The code is mainly written to be used for space curve projects (curvature and
// torsion computations are more stable using ENO).
//
// The coefficients are stored in the "coeffs_" array starting with the coefficient of the 
// lowest degree.
//
// For an interval [x(i), x(i+1)], it is always true that
// p(x(i)) = f(x(i)) and p(x(i+1)) = f(x(i+1)) where p is the fitting polynomial.
// In other words, the fitting polynomial always passes through the start and end points of the interval.
//
// Remark: The user is responsible for ensuring that x samples of (x, f(x)) pairs must be different 
// from each other. This is not checked in the code for speed efficiency.
