// \brief computes a distance transform for any object
//
//  This templated class maintains two sets of 2D arrays, one of
//  objects and one of distances.  An initial map of object locations
//  is provided to the constructor.  At construction time a similar
//  array of distances is initialized assigning zero distance at all
//  locations where objects are found.  The chamfer algorithms is
//  applied and objects are propagated with distances.  The result
//  is a distance transform with refences to the nearest object at
//  each location.

//: chamfer distance transform class
// This class is templated over object type \pOBJ_T and distance type \pDIST_T
//
// Object types need to support a cast to boolean, where false indicates the
// absence of an object.  Typically objects are pointers, smart pointers, or
// indices where the NULL pointer or zero index casts to false.
//
// Distance types need to support addition, the <= operator, and
// vcl_numeric_limits<DIST_T>::max().  They must also exibit
// a strict weak ordering.  Distance types are typically \pint or \pfloat.

 public:

  //: Constructor
  // \param object_map is a map of the initial object locations.  Occupied locations
  //                   should evaluate to true under boolean cast while unoccupied
  //                   locations should evaluate to false.
  // \param dist1 is the distance in the horizontal and vertical directions between elements.
  // \param dist2 is the distance in the diagonal directions between elements.
  // \note typically \pdist2 = \pdist1 * sqrt(2) but this must be approximated if
  //       \pDIST_T is descrete (i.e. dist1=3 and dist2=4)
