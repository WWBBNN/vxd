*
* This library contains functions for proximity computations of geometric
* objects. One example is computing the distance of a given polyline to a set of
* pixels using Distance Transform.
*
* More functions of this type can be found in brcv/rec/dbcsi, which uses higher
* level libraries and primitives than the present one.
