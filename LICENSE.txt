VXD is released under the terms of the VXL License:
  https://sourceforge.net/p/vxl/git/ci/master/tree/core/vxl_copyright.h,
unless otherwise stated on the relavant files or subfolders.

ATTENTION: Since VXD is a heavily experimental codebase, it may use fragments of
GPL or LGPL or not-for-commecial-use code in isolated libraries. The user is
responsible to carfully consider this prior to releasing other code based on
VXD.  One example is contrib/brld/bbasd/bild, which uses a modification of LGPL
code.  Therefore, any code that includes or links against bild directly or
indirectly must observe the terms of the LGPL. Another example is
contrib/brld/b3pd/triangulation_kanatani optimal triangulation code, which does
not allow commercial use without explicit permission.

However, any modification of code originally authored by Ricardo Fabbri under the GPL
is hereby granted by Ricardo Fabbri himself any further freedom given by the VXL
license.

VXD is a very diverse collection of libraries. Therefore, If you want to be
absolutely clean about copyright issues, kindly contact the authors of the relevant files
when releasing professional code based on VXD.
