Since VXD is a heavily experimental codebase, it may use fragments of GPL or
LGPL code in isolated libraries. The user is responsible to carfully consider
this prior to releasing other code based on VXD.  One example is
contrib/brld/bbasd/bild, which uses a modification of LGPL code.  Therefore, any
code that includes or links against bild directly or indirectly must observe the
terms of the LGPL.

Any modification of code originally authored by Ricardo Fabbri under the GPL
is hereby granted by Ricardo Fabbri himself any further freedom by the VXL
license.

VXD is a very diverse collection of libraries. Therefore, If you want to be
absolutely clean about copyright issues, when releasing professional code based on
VXD, kindly contact the authors of the relevant files.
